Project: XAI_Desktop — AI Smart Desktop

Project summary:
- This repository implements a macOS transparent desktop overlay for organizing files, folders, and apps into floating Smart Containers (grids), built with Tauri 2 + React 19 in a Turborepo + pnpm monorepo.
- The default working unit is `plugin-<name>` under `packages/` (e.g. `packages/plugin-organizer/`). XAI_Desktop's "plugins" ARE its feature slices — there is no separate pluggable-capability layer.

Architecture:
- `packages/core/` contains shared infrastructure only (types, typed events at `packages/core/src/events/`, PluginRegistry, hooks). Zero business logic.
- `packages/` contains business slices as `plugin-*` packages and is the default landing zone for feature code.
- `apps/desktop/src/` is the Tauri host shell — routing, providers, window shells; zero business logic.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/` is the Rust backend — modular commands (`commands/`) + macOS platform adapters (`platform/macos/`).
- `apps/web/` and `apps/docs/` are Next.js companion sites at scaffolding stage — not the primary product frontend.

Key boundaries:
- Do not move business logic into `apps/desktop/src/` or `packages/core/` — keep it in `packages/plugin-*`.
- Plugin-to-plugin interaction goes through `@repo/core/events` (typed events), never direct imports.
- `index.ts` is a plugin's only public surface — never import from `packages/plugin-*/src/internal/`.
- Generic UI components → `packages/ui/`; business components → inside the owning plugin.
- Rust commands in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/commands/`; macOS platform code in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/platform/macos/`.
- Do not touch macOS window level constants without testing on real hardware.
- If `manifest.json` is touched on a plugin, keep it aligned with actual runtime loading behavior.

Documentation contract:
- `packages/plugin-<name>/docs/design.md` — Decision snapshot / dependency overview
- `packages/plugin-<name>/docs/api.md` — Interface contracts / error semantics
- `packages/plugin-<name>/docs/test.md` — Test strategy / mock strategy / acceptance criteria
- `packages/plugin-<name>/docs/dev_log.md` — Workflow state machine / breakpoint continuity
- `docs/reviews/<feature>/<YYYYMMDD>-feature-brief.md` for new features (Step 0 artifact)
- `docs/reviews/<feature>/<YYYYMMDD>-discovery-review.md` for discovery passes
- `docs/PLUGIN_MAP.md` — global state map; only Stable/Production plugins can be depended on. In-Dev/Migrating plugins must be mocked when used as a dependency.
- `docs/adr/NNNN-*.md` — architecture decision records

Workflow references:
- docs/workflow/SUBAGENT_WORKFLOW_V2.md
- docs/workflow/SOP_NEW_FEATURE.md
- docs/workflow/SOP_BUGFIX.md
- docs/conventions/COMMIT_CONVENTION.md

Required conventions:
- Cross-window contracts use the typed event layer at `packages/core/src/events/` (wrapping Tauri emit/listen). Tauri commands return typed `Result<T, String>`. There is no HTTP API response envelope.
- `dev_log.md` is the source of truth for workflow state.
- Every workflow write should maintain `Workflow`, `Executor`, `Updated`, `Suggested Next` and append `Work Log`.
- Commit messages follow `type(scope): summary` plus body with Why / What / Scope / Risk / Docs / Tests.
- `feature-build` does ONE phase per run, then stops for human confirmation.
- `ship` requires `READY_TO_SHIP` status and human confirmation to push.

Testing expectations:
- Unit tests: `pnpm --filter @repo/core test` (Vitest).
- Rust tests: `cargo test` in `apps/desktop/src-tauri/`.
- Desktop manual verification: `pnpm dev` in `apps/desktop/`.
- Multi-window behaviour must be checked on real macOS hardware before ship.
