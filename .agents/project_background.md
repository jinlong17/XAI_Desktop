Project: XAI_Desktop (AI Smart Desktop)

Project summary:
- This repository implements a macOS transparent desktop overlay that lets users organize files, folders, and apps into floating "Smart Containers" (grids), built with Tauri 2 + React 19 in a monorepo.
- The default working unit is `<feature_name>` under `features/`.

Architecture:
- `apps/desktop/` is the Tauri host shell: windowing, tray, shortcuts, global settings, plugin mounting. Zero business logic.
- `apps/desktop/src-tauri/src/lib.rs` is the Rust backend handling window lifecycle and macOS native APIs (Cocoa, NSWindow levels).
- `packages/plugin-*` contains feature modules as React packages (e.g., `plugin-organizer` for Smart Containers, grid system, file drop).
- `packages/ui/` contains shared React components.
- `apps/web/` and `apps/docs/` are Next.js companion sites (scaffolding stage).
- Multi-window architecture:
  - Main window: click-through transparent overlay, coordinates grids via OrganizerLayer.
  - Control window: AI Cube + Settings panel (360x360).
  - Grid windows: one native window per grid, positioned above desktop icons.
- Cross-window communication via Tauri event system (emit/listen).

Tech stack:
- Frontend: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite
- Desktop: Tauri 2 (macOS private APIs, Cocoa integration)
- Monorepo: Turborepo + pnpm workspaces
- State: React Context + localStorage persistence (1s debounce)
- DnD: @dnd-kit (core) + react-draggable (positioning)

Key boundaries:
- Do not move business logic into `apps/desktop/src/` — keep it in `packages/plugin-*`.
- Plugin-to-plugin interaction goes through Tauri events, not direct imports.
- Rust backend handles window lifecycle and macOS native APIs only.
- Do not touch macOS window level constants without testing on real hardware.
- `packages/plugin-organizer/src/types.ts` defines the canonical data types (GridBox, DesktopItem, PersistedLayout).

Documentation contract:
- `features/<feature>/docs/design.md` — Decision snapshot / dependency overview
- `features/<feature>/docs/api.md` — Interface contracts / error semantics
- `features/<feature>/docs/test.md` — Test strategy / mock strategy / acceptance criteria
- `features/<feature>/docs/dev_log.md` — Workflow state machine / breakpoint continuity
- `docs/reviews/<feature>/<YYYYMMDD>-discovery-review.md` — New feature discovery report

Workflow references:
- `docs/workflow/SUBAGENT_WORKFLOW_V2.md`

Required conventions:
- `dev_log.md` is the source of truth for workflow state.
- Every workflow write must maintain: Workflow, Executor, Updated, Suggested Next, and append Work Log.
- Commit messages follow `type(scope): summary` plus body fields (Why / What / Scope / Risk / Docs / Tests).

Testing expectations:
- Desktop app: `pnpm dev` in `apps/desktop/` for manual verification, check multi-window behavior.
- New features should cover unit, contract, and end-to-end scenarios as appropriate.
- Bugfixes must verify the original reproduction path plus key boundary cases.

Tooling notes:
- Preferred planning/review model: opus
- Preferred implementation model: sonnet
- Preferred verification model: opus
